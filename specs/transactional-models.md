## Overview

**Purpose:** Describe the multi-stage process of building Unified Models for VM deployment.

**Context:** MIND Universe VM deployment backend.

**Problem:** VM deployment requires multi-source, multi-stage model construction.

## Architecture

### Model States

The Prototype state is built from Source Unit and Placement data sources, tightly coupling the model to infrastructure specifics. User customization transforms the prototype into the Base state, allowing overrides of default values. The Complete state is reached after Universe validation and enrichment with platform-specific default arguments, making the model ready for deployment.

## Model States

| State | Source | Purpose |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Prototype** | Source Unit + Placement | Initial model tied to data sources |
| **Base** | User customization | User overrides prototype values |
| **Complete** | Universe validation + defaults | Ready for deployment |

---

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Alternative | Rationale |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| **Three-state model** | Single-state | Clear separation of concerns |
| **User customization step** | Direct deploy | User control over final config |
| **Validation before deploy** | Validate on target | Catch errors early |

---

## Rollback Mechanism ⚠️

> **Note:** A rollback mechanism was implemented through DRUID API calls to remove redundant CIRs during deployment. This feature exists in the codebase but cannot be publicly documented due to NDA restrictions.

---

## Trade-offs

| Trade-off | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Multi-stage process | Increased complexity |
| User customization | More flexibility, more validation |
| Default values | Consistency across platforms |
